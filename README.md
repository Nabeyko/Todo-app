## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **React 18** – UI library for component-based architecture.
* **TypeScript** – For static type checking and enhanced developer experience.
* **Vite** – Lightning-fast build tool and dev server.
* **Context API** – Global state management via `GlobalProvider`.
* **SCSS** – Modular styling with BEM methodology.

## ✨ Key Features & Architecture
* **Global State Management:** Uses a custom `GlobalProvider` to manage tasks across the entire component tree without prop drilling.
* **Strict Typing:** Interfaces and types are defined in `src/types/` for all data structures (Todos, Context, Props).
* **Vite-Optimized:** Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and optimized production builds.
* **CRUD Operations:** Full cycle of task management with persistent storage.
* **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach for seamless use on any device.
